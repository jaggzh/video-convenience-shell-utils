# Miscellaneous video utilities for use from CLI

Most are bash but some are python.
I'm starting with just one though. :}

# Usage:

1. Clone this somewhere.
2. Simlink any desired scripts in your favorite bin/ path.
  (I have ~/bin/ in my $PATH so I put my stuff there)
  ```
  cd ~/bin
  ln -s /path/to/cloned/repos/video-convenience-shell-utils/vid-fps-change-without-rencoding
  ```
