# Miscellaneous video utilities for use from CLI

Some are bash, some python, some perl.
I'm just starting with this one bash script.

# Background

I like my fingers and joints and time.  I don't like remembering ffmpeg options and, in general, have learned to start putting almost anything I need, repeatedly, into scripts.

I give them long names, that make sense to me, for tab completion.
(Example: `vid-<tab>` (looking...) `vid-fps<tab>`)

# Usage:

1. Clone this somewhere.
2. Simlink any desired scripts in your favorite bin/ path.
  (I have ~/bin/ in my $PATH so I put my stuff there)
  ```
  cd ~/bin
  ln -s /path/to/cloned/repos/video-convenience-shell-utils/vid-fps-change-without-rencoding
  ```
